### üéâ Hello everyone! Today, I want to share a super practical treasure with all HarmonyOS developers‚Äîthe multi-window adaptation cases hidden in the official HarmonyOS documentation! Have you often found solutions in the docs during development but couldn't find specific code references? I recently uncovered these hidden cases and quickly organized them to share with you!  

### üåà I. Window Breakpoint Adaptation: No More Need to Write Two Sets of Code for Foldable Screens!  
#### Scenario Pain Points:  
The same window width on different devices (e.g., unfolded foldable screens and horizontal mobile phones) may correspond to different layouts. Simply judging by width can fail!  

#### Core Code from Official Case:  
```typescript
// Listen for window changes in UIAbility lifecycle  
onWindowStageCreate(windowStage: window.WindowStage) {  
  windowStage.getMainWindow().then((windowObj) => {  
    // Initialize breakpoints  
    this.calculateBreakpoints(windowObj);  
    // Dynamically listen for window size changes  
    windowObj.on('windowSizeChange', (newSize) => {  
      this.updateBreakpoints(newSize);  
      // Trigger global state update for page layout  
      AppStorage.setOrCreate('currentLayout', this.getLayoutMode());  
    });  
  });  
}  
```  

#### Pitfall Prevention Guide:  
‚óè The aspect ratio of the unfolded Huawei Mate X3 is close to 1:1, which should be distinguished from the horizontal screen of ordinary mobile phones.  
‚óè For global state management, @StorageLink/@StorageProp are recommended for automatic synchronization.  


### üì± II. Portrait/Landscape Rotation Strategy: Adaptive for Small Foldable External Screens!  
#### Real Pitfall Experience:  
The external screen of Huawei Pocket S is a square screen, but it would be identified as a portrait mobile phone according to traditional judgment logic, causing videos to fail to play in landscape mode!  

#### Official Recommended Solution:  
```typescript
// Dynamically judge based on aspect ratio  
const aspectRatio = windowHeightVp / windowWidthVp;  
if (aspectRatio >= 0.8 && aspectRatio <= 1.2) {  
  // Force rotation for near-square screens  
  windowObj.setPreferredOrientation(window.Orientation.AUTO_ROTATION);  
} else if (deviceType === 'foldable') {  
  // Special handling for unfolded foldable screens  
  handleFoldableScreen();  
}  
```  

#### Device Compatibility List:  
| Device Type       | Rotation Strategy       |  
|-------------------|-------------------------|  
| Straight mobile phone | Default portrait        |  
| Pocket external screen | Forced on (aspect ratio ‚âà1:1) |  
| MatePad tablet     | Full-direction rotation |  


### üñ•Ô∏è III. PC-Style Free Window Adaptation: Windows-Like Window Operations Are Awesome!  
#### Unexpected Features:  
‚óè Minimum window size restrictions  
‚óè Customizable title bar (hide the logo but retain the close button)  
‚óè Seamless switching between full-screen and windowed modes  

#### Key Configuration Code:  
```json
// Must be configured in module.json5!  
"abilities": [{  
  "minWindowWidth": 320,  
  "minWindowHeight": 480,  
  "maxWindowWidth": 2560,  
  "maxWindowHeight": 1600  
}]  
```  

#### Black Technology for Window Mode Switching:  
```typescript
// Double-click to full-screen/exit  
@State isFullscreen: boolean = false;  

Button().onClick(() => {  
  if (this.isFullscreen) {  
    windowUtil.recover(); // Exit full-screen  
  } else {  
    windowUtil.maximize({ enterImmersive: true }); // Immersive full-screen  
  }  
})  
```  


### üåå IV. Ultimate Solution for Immersive Adaptation: Cool Transparent Status Bar!  
#### Common Mistakes by Newcomers:  
Directly setting full-screen ‚Üí content is blocked by the status bar!  

#### Correct Approach:  
```typescript
// Step1: Set full-screen mode  
windowObj.setWindowLayoutFullScreen(true);  

// Step2: Get the avoidance area  
const avoidTop = px2vp(window.getWindowAvoidArea(window.AvoidAreaType.SYSTEM).topRect.height);  

// Step3: Dynamically adjust the layout  
Column() {  
  // Content area  
}  
.padding({ top: avoidTop }) // Leave space for the status bar at the top  
```  


### üí° Final Thoughts  
Multi-window adaptation may seem complex at first, but HarmonyOS actually provides many ready-made solutions! Recommendations:  
1. Install official sample templates with ohpm more often  
   `ohpm install @ohos/multi-window-demo`  
2. Make good use of DevEco's previewer for multi-device simulation  
   (Foldable screen unfolding animations can be previewed directly!)  
3. When encountering problems, first check the [Developer Q&A Community]  
   90% of pitfalls have been encountered by predecessors~
